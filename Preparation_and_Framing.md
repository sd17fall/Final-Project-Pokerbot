# Preparation and Framing

### Background and context

*What information about your project does the audience need to participate fully in the technical review? You should share enough to make sure your audience understands the questions you are asking, but without going into unnecessary detail.*

We are creating a poker simulator that can play Heads-Up Texas Hold'Em. It will parse poker data (specifically betting amounts and outcomes) and use machine learning to calculate betting strategy based on hand strength and bet amount of other players.

### Key questions

*What do you want to learn from the review? What are the most important decisions your team is currently contemplating? Where might an outside perspective be most helpful? As you select key questions to ask during the review, bear in mind both the time limitations and background of your audience.*

- Are there any showstoppers that you see?
- Any concerns about things that we are glossing over at this point?
- If anyone knows things about machine learning, hit us up

### Agenda for technical review session

*Be specific about how you plan to use your allotted time. What strategies will you use to communicate with your audience?*
