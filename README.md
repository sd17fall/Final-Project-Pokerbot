### Prerequisites

All the libraries we used in the main code, as well as in our test code and old versions, are included in our requirements.txt file. You can install them by running:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can choose which libraries to install as necessary by typing the following into your command line:

- pip install pygame
- pip install gym

- pip install flask

The PokerBot's machine learning data is loaded from, updated to, and saved in sa_cache.txt.
